# Kelvin Shadewing's Pixel Repo

This repository is for hosting sprite and tileset resources for various games to use freely. Links to individual files will remain on my site, but with this repo, the latest version of each file will always be available.

## Contribution

You may contribute graphical assets of your own to be added to the project. I will look them over and make any necessary adjustments.

For color values, please use multiples of eight for each color. The hex values of each color will have 8 or 0 for every other digit, like so: #F8D090.
